OCT - An open clinical terminology

## Overview

There are already a number of other clinical terminologies available, but none of them are open and free to use without restrictions. This project aims to create a clinical terminology that is open, free to use, and community-driven.

The terminology will be developed using an open-source approach, with contributions from clinicians, developers, and other stakeholders. The goal is to create a terminology that is comprehensive, accurate, and easy to use.

## Design Philosophy

Each of the following decisions is open for discussion and debate:

* **Open and Free**: The terminology will be licensed under an open license, allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute it without restrictions.

* **Clinically Relevant**: The terminology will focus on concepts that are relevant to clinical practice, ensuring that it meets the needs of healthcare professionals.

* **Namespace-Hierarchy Separation**: OCT will focus on defining a namespace of concept identifiers and internationalised descriptions. The hierarchical relationships between concepts will be managed by separate ontologies that reference OCT concept identifiers.

## Strategy

I have been told that creating a new clinical terminology is impossible, or just pointless because of the dominance of some existing terminologies. 

However, I believe that an open and free terminology can fill a gap in the current landscape. The strategy for developing OCT is:

0. **If we don't start, it will never happen.** Hence, we are starting **now**.

1. **Crowdsource**: Anyone may contribute to the terminology, following a transparent and open process.

2. **Adopt**: Existing open works which have a compatible license may be incorporated into the OCT.
