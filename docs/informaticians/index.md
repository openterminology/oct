# Informaticians

This section is for clinical informaticians, information architects, and standards implementers.

Potential topics:

- Design principles behind `oct`
- Identifier and namespace strategy
- Relationship to other standards (e.g. SNOMED CT, ICD, openEHR)
- Integration patterns in clinical systems

> TODO: Add more detailed conceptual and architectural documentation.
