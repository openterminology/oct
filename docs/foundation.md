# Foundation and Custodianship

## Current ownership

- **Copyright:** 2022-2025 Baw Medical Ltd.
- **Custodianship:** Baw Medical Ltd is the legal owner and custodian of the `oct` project and its associated assets (code, terminology data, documentation, trademarks, domains, and governance artefacts).
- **Stewardship approach:** Assets are held on behalf of the community to keep the project stable while its governance matures.

## Path to an independent foundation

The strategic goal is to transfer `oct` into the ownership of an independent non-profit foundation. This foundation may be:

- An existing and trusted open-source or healthcare-oriented foundation, or
- A new non-profit entity established specifically for `oct`.

We will select the path that best safeguards openness, transparency, and community trust. Transfer plans will be developed in consultation with contributors and users to ensure the foundation can assume legal ownership of all relevant intellectual property.

## Interim governance

Until the transfer occurs, Baw Medical Ltd will continue to hold and protect the project assets as custodian. Operational governance remains with the project leadership (including the BDFL) while processes and community structures are refined to support the eventual handover.
