# OCT Overview and Governance Specification

This document distills how Open Clinical Terminology ("`oct`") is intended to operate, drawing from the repository README and current project documentation. It should be used as a source of truth for contributors and for future automation that needs to understand the core rules of the project.

## Project Purpose and Philosophy
- **Goal**: create an open, community-driven clinical terminology that is free to use, modify, and redistribute.
- **Clinical focus**: prioritise clinically relevant concepts while keeping identifiers non-semantic.
- **Namespace/Hierarchy separation**: concept identifiers live in `oct`; any hierarchical relationships are handled by separate ontologies that reference these identifiers.
- **Community ownership**: decisions are consensus-driven with final tie-breaking by the BDFL. Contributions should link to discussions on the Open Health Hub `oct` category when proposing changes.

## Namespace Requirements
The identifier format is designed to satisfy the namespace requirements documented in the repository README:
- **Unique (NS001)**: each identifier points to exactly one concept.
- **Non-semantic (NS002)**: identifiers carry no embedded meaning.
- **Persistent (NS003)**: identifiers are never reused; inactive concepts remain addressable.
- **Short and human-communicable (NS004–NS005)**: identifiers should be easy to type and verbalise.
- **URL/filename safe (NS006)**: no special encoding required in paths.
- **Future-proof and recognisable (NS007–NS008)**: namespace space is large enough for growth and distinguishable as `oct`.

## Licensing Expectations
`oct` treats different assets with licences suited to their role:
- **Software**: Apache 2.0
- **Terminology data**: CC-BY 4.0
- **Documentation & specifications**: CC-BY 4.0
- **Branding**: trademark protection for the `oct` name and logo

Redistribution of CC-BY content must attribute the project and link back to the canonical repository. Commercial use is encouraged provided attribution is preserved and branding is not misused.

## Contribution Rules
- Raise proposed changes via Issues or Pull Requests with rationale and links to relevant discussions.
- All contributions adopt the licence appropriate to the component being changed (Apache 2.0 for code, CC-BY 4.0 for data/docs).
- **AI/LLM content**: clinical content must not be generated by AI/LLMs. Using AI to assist with code or tooling is acceptable when there is no copyright risk.

## Tooling Surface
- **CLI entrypoint**: the executable wrapper at the repository root (`./oct`) imports the Python CLI from `tools/oct.py`.
- **Data root**: CLI defaults point to the `terms/` directory at the repository root, using language-specific subfolders such as `terms/en-GB/`.
- **Versioning**: the Click-based CLI currently reports version `0.1.1`.

## Path and Logging Conventions
- Concept files use the `.oct` extension and are stored under language directories (for example, `terms/en-GB/<id>.oct`).
- Creating a new concept logs an ISO 8601 timestamp and the identifier to `terms/terms` for traceability.
- File operations use `pathlib.Path` to remain cross-platform and create parent directories as needed when writing.
