# Tooling (CLI, APIs)

This page will document tools and programmatic interfaces for working with Open Clinical Terminology (`oct`).

Planned content:

- Overview of the Python CLI in `tools/oct.py`
- Commands for validating, searching, and building terminology
- How to call `oct` from other scripts or services
- API patterns if/when a service layer is introduced

> TODO: Fill in with concrete command examples and usage once the tooling is stable.
