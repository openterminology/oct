# Open Content Terminology (OCT) Licensing

OCT combines software components with domain knowledge and terminology. To clarify permitted use, OCT is offered under two complementary licenses:

1. **Software (code, scripts, and configuration)** – Licensed under the MIT License.
2. **Terminology and knowledge assets** – Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).

If you use both the software and the terminology together, you must comply with both licenses. The sections below explain what each license covers and how to attribute properly.

## 1) Software – MIT License

Unless explicitly noted otherwise, all source code, scripts, and configuration files in this repository are provided under the MIT License:
